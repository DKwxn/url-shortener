### API Endpoints

#### Shorten URL

- **Endpoint:**

    ```
    POST /shorten
    ```

- **Description:**

    This endpoint takes a long URL and returns a shortened URL. The client needs to send a POST request with the original URL in the request body.

- **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
        "url": "http://example.com"
    }
    ```

- **Response:**

    ```json
    {
        "short_url": "http://localhost:8080/abc123"
    }
    ```

- **Example with `curl`:**

    ```sh
    curl -X POST -d '{"url":"http://example.com"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/shorten
    ```

    This command sends a POST request with a JSON payload containing the URL to be shortened. The server responds with the shortened URL.

#### Redirect to Original URL

- **Endpoint:**

    ```
    GET /{short_url}
    ```

- **Description:**

    This endpoint takes the short URL path and redirects the client to the original long URL. The `{short_url}` is a placeholder for the actual shortened URL path generated by the shorten URL endpoint.

- **Example:**

    If you received the short URL `http://localhost:8080/abc123` from the `/shorten` endpoint, you can access it in your browser or using `curl`:

    ```sh
    curl -L http://localhost:8080/abc123
    ```

    This command sends a GET request to the short URL. The server responds with a redirection to the original URL.
